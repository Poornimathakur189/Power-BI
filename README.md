# Real-Time Data Analytics Project on Employee Presence Using Power BI

Author: Poornima Thakur 30 May 2024

## Project Overview

In this project, I analyze employee presence data to derive insights about their attendance patterns. Using Power BI, I gather, transform, and analyze data related to employee attendance, 
including instances of Work from Home (WFH), Work from Office (WFO), half days, leaves, and sick leaves. The goal is to provide stakeholders with valuable insights into employee attendance behavior and patterns.

## Key Features

1. Data Gathering and Transformation
   - Utilizing Power Query in Power BI to collect and transform data from multiple Excel sheets with different column headers.
   - Integrating diverse data sources to ensure consistency and readiness for analysis.

2. Attendance Metrics Creation Using DAX
   - Calculating the percentage of 'Work from Home' (WFH).
   - Calculating the percentage of 'Work from Office' (WFO).
   - Calculating the percentage of half days.
   - Calculating the percentage of leaves.
   - Calculating the percentage of sick leaves.
   - Identifying additional metrics that provide further insights into employee attendance patterns.

3. Dashboarding Techniques
   - Designing interactive and informative dashboards to visualize attendance data.
   - Presenting data in an accessible manner to facilitate decision-making by stakeholders.

4. Stakeholder Engagement and Strategic Partnership
   - Engaging with stakeholders to gather and understand their requirements and expectations.
   - Asking pertinent questions to keep stakeholders involved and informed throughout the project.
   - Positioning myself as a strategic partner by providing solutions that align with business objectives.

5. Scoping Future Requirements
   - Delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that addresses immediate stakeholder needs.
   - Identifying future requirements and potential enhancements for continuous improvement based on stakeholder feedback.

## Project Workflow

1. **Understanding Requirements**
   - Engage with the client to gather initial requirements and understand the business context of employee attendance.
   - Ask targeted questions to clarify needs and expectations regarding attendance insights.

2. **Data Collection and Transformation**
   - Use Power Query to import data from multiple Excel sheets, focusing on employee presence and absence records.
   - Transform the data to ensure consistency and readiness for analysis, addressing challenges such as varying column headers.

3. **Creating Attendance Metrics with DAX**
   - Develop key metrics such as the percentage of 'Work from Home' (WFH), 'Work from Office' (WFO), half days, leaves, and sick leaves.
   - Explore and create additional metrics to provide deeper insights into attendance patterns.

4. **Designing Dashboards**
   - Create dashboards that effectively visualize attendance data and metrics.
   - Ensure dashboards are user-friendly and support decision-making processes by providing clear and actionable insights.

5. **Delivering the MVP**
   - Present the MVP to stakeholders, showcasing the initial insights and metrics.
   - Gather feedback from stakeholders to identify additional requirements and plan for future iterations and enhancements.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Power Query Mastery**: Learn to efficiently gather and transform data from various sources using Power Query.
- **DAX Proficiency**: Develop skills in creating complex attendance metrics using DAX.
- **Dashboarding Skills**: Gain expertise in designing informative and interactive dashboards in Power BI.
- **Client Engagement**: Understand the importance of active listening and strategic questioning in stakeholder engagement.
- **Project Scoping**: Learn to deliver an MVP and plan for future enhancements based on stakeholder feedback.

## Conclusion
